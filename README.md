# Card.realfx.rocks

This is a showcase website that gets a card from
<a href="https://pronouns.page/">pronouns.page</a>,
and then displays it.

## Can I host it myself?

Yes! Go ahead!

Just let me know, by messaging me on <a href="https://discord.gg/qFdvxqsRg5">Discord</a>!

## How does it work?

It works by getting a Dark-Mode card from Pronouns.Page's API,
so if you use your username on this,
you have to Generate a DarkMode Card image on your pronouns.page page.

On the though of using your own username:

### How do I use it?

Just visiting the site normally, shows *my* card.

If you wanna use your own card, simply supply it as a parameter:

```
Example for the username "sometime":
https://card.realfx.rocks/?username=sometime

Example for the username "realfx":
https://card.realfx.rocks/?username=realfx
```
